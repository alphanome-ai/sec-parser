# Overview

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/3f16a04008d34932b8b8acff8c8aabca)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/alphanome-ai/sec-parser?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=alphanome-ai/sec-parser&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

The `sec-parser` project simplifies extracting meaningful information from SEC EDGAR HTML documents by organizing them into semantic elements and a tree structure. Semantic elements might include section titles, paragraphs, and tables, each classified for easier data manipulation. This forms a semantic tree that corresponds to the visual and informational structure of the document. If you're familiar with the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=image+semantic+segmentation" target="_blank">Image Semantic Segmentation</a> concept, it's the same but applied to HTML documents.

This tool is especially beneficial for Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Large Language Models (LLM) applications by streamlining data pre-processing and feature extraction.

- Data Augmentation: Use authentic financial text to train and test machine learning models.

#### Causal AI
- Causal Analysis: Use parsed data to understand cause-effect relationships in financial data, beyond mere correlations.
- Predictive Modeling: Enhance predictive models by incorporating causal relationships, leading to more robust and reliable predictions.
- Decision Making: Aid decision-making processes by providing insights into the potential impact of different actions, based on causal relationships identified in the data.

#### Large Language Models
- LLM Compatible: Use parsed data to facilitate complex NLU tasks with Large Language Models like ChatGPT, including question-answering, language translation, and information retrieval.

These use-cases demonstrate the flexibility and power of `sec-parser` in handling both traditional data extraction tasks and facilitating more advanced AI-driven analysis.

# Getting Started

This guide will walk you through the process of installing the `sec-parser` package and using it to extract the "Segment Operating Performance" section as a semantic tree from the latest Apple 10-Q filing.

## Installation

First, install the `sec-parser` package using pip:

```bash
pip install sec-parser
```

In order to run the example code in this README, you'll also need the `sec_downloader` package:

```bash
pip install sec-downloader
```

## Usage

Once you've installed the necessary packages, you can start by downloading the filing from the SEC EDGAR website. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from sec_downloader import Downloader

# Initialize the downloader with your company name and email
dl = Downloader("MyCompanyName", "email@example.com")

# Download the latest 10-Q filing for Apple
html = dl.get_latest_html("10-Q", "AAPL")
```

> **Note**
The company name and email address are used to form a user-agent string that adheres to the SEC EDGAR's fair access policy for programmatic downloading. [Source](https://www.sec.gov/os/webmaster-faq#code-support)

Now, we can parse the filing into semantic elements and arrange them into a tree structure:

```python
import sec_parser as sp

# Parse the HTML into a list of semantic elements
elements = sp.Edgar10QParser().parse(html)

# Construct a semantic tree to allow for easy filtering by section
tree = sp.TreeBuilder().build(elements)

# Find section "Segment Operating Performance"
section = [n for n in tree.nodes if n.text.startswith("Segment")][0]

# Preview the tree
print("\n".join(sp.render(section).split("\n")[:13]) + "...")
```

# Best Practices

## How to Import Modules In Your Code

To ensure your code remains functional even when we update `sec-parser`, it's recommended to avoid complex imports. Don't use intricate import statements that go deep into the package, like this:

from sec_parser.semantic_tree.internal_utils import SomeInternalClass

Here are the suggested ways to import modules from `sec-parser`:

### Basic Import
- **Standard Way**: Use `import sec_parser as sp`  
  This imports the main package as `sp`. You can then access its functionalities using `sp.` prefix.

### Specific Import
- **Package-Level Import**: Use `from sec_parser import SomeClass`  
  This allows you to directly use `SomeClass` without any prefix.

### Submodule Import
- **Submodule**: Use `from sec_parser import semantic_tree`  
  This imports the `semantic_tree` submodule, and you can access its classes and functions using `semantic_tree.` prefix.

### More Specific Submodule Import
- **Submodule-Level**: Use `from sec_parser.semantic_tree import SomeClass`  
  This imports a specific class `SomeClass` from the `semantic_tree` submodule.

> **Note**
The main package `sec_parser` contains only the most common functionalities. For specialized tasks, please use submodule or submodule-level imports.
