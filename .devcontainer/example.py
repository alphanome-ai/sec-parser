# Utility function to make the example code a bit more compact
def print_first_n_lines(text: str, *, n: int) -> None:
    pass


# Initialize the downloader with your company name and email
dl = Downloader("MyCompanyName", "email@example.com")

# Download the latest 10-Q filing for Apple
html = dl.get_filing_html(ticker="AAPL", form="10-Q")

# Now, we can parse the filing HTML into a list of semantic elements:
elements: list = sp.Edgar10QParser().parse(html)
demo_output: str = sp.render(elements)
print_first_n_lines(demo_output, n=7)

# We can also construct a semantic tree to allow for easy filtering by parent sections:
tree = sp.TreeBuilder().build(elements)
demo_output: str = sp.render(tree)
print_first_n_lines(demo_output, n=7)
