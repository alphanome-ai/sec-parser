this Agreement, Aura agrees to respond timely to all requests by BetterSea for instructions, information, or other action and agrees
that Aura&rsquo;s failure to timely respond to any such request shall be deemed to be an instruction by Aura that no action is
to be taken with respect to such matter.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">BetterSea&rsquo;s fees for services are
based primary on the actual time expended performing services multiplied by the hourly rates then in effect for its personnel.
Currently, the hourly rate of BetterSea&rsquo;s senior technical and sales consultants is: $250 per hour; $175-$200 per hour for
junior technical and sales consultants; and $60-100 per hour for other support members. Charged time includes all time personnel
spend relating to Aura&rsquo;s matters, including without limitation, travel time. Please note that BetterSea may assign various
people to Aura&rsquo;s matters, as BetterSea deems appropriate.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">BetterSea will bill Aura monthly for its
services and each invoice shall be paid by Aura within thirty (30) calendar days of Aura&rsquo;s receipt thereof. It is the policy
of BetterSea that it will perform no further services for Aura if Aura becomes more than sixty (60) days delinquent in the payment
of BetterSea&rsquo;s bills, unless an arrangement to cure the delinquency is made in writing and agreed to by both parties. Please
note that BetterSea&rsquo;s hourly rates are adjusted periodically to reflect the advancing experience, capabilities and seniority
of the BetterSea&rsquo;s professionals as well as general economic factors. BetterSea reserves the right to adjust such rates upon
30 calendar days&rsquo; notice to Aura.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The foregoing notwithstanding, with respect
to each Sale (as defined below), BetterSea shall be entitled to compensation equal to the greater of: (i) a commission equal to
five percent (5%) of the Net Amount (as defined below) of such Sale (a &ldquo;Commission&rdquo;) or (ii) the amount of its hourly
billings associated with such Sale calculated as of the date that such Sale is deemed to have occurred, as described below (the
&ldquo;Invoiced Amount&rdquo;). To the extent that BetterSea is entitled to a Commission with respect to a Sale and Aura has previously
paid some or all of BetterSea&rsquo;s invoiced hourly billings relating to such Sale, the Commission due to BetterSea with respect
thereto shall then be reduced by the amount already paid. For purposes of this Agreement, a &ldquo;Sale&rdquo; shall mean any sale
by Aura of any of its current or future products under contracts occurring now or in the future that result from any introduction
or other intervention by BetterSea commenced on or before January 1, 2019, including, without limitation, any purchase order (or
similar document) issued by a customer introduced to Aura by BetterSea and any grants or other contract awards issued to Aura that
were identified by BetterSea or for which BetterSea&rsquo;s intervention was a substantial factor in Aura&rsquo;s receipt thereof.
A Sale is deemed to occur upon the sooner of: (a) Aura&rsquo;s receipt of a purchase order (or equivalent document) from an applicable
customer; or (b) the announcement of Aura&rsquo;s receipt of any applicable grant or contract award; for the avoidance of doubt,
however, it is hereby confirmed that, regardless of the particular timing of any Sale occurrence, so long as the underlying introduction
or other intervention forming the basis of the Sale occurred on or before January 1, 2019, BetterSea shall be entitled to a Commission
or the Invoiced Amount, as applicable, with respect to such Sale. The &ldquo;Net Amount&rdquo; of a Sale shall equal the gross
amount of the applicable transaction, award or grant less any tax(es) required to be charged to the customer or other contract/award
issuing authority by Aura and/or any applicable shipping charges relating to such Sale.</P>

auspices of J.A.M.S and before a retired judge or justice. If the parties are unable to agree upon a retired superior court judge

or relating to this Agreement or the services provided hereunder will be entitled to recover as costs the reasonable expenses incurred
therewith, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees, arbitrator fees, expert fees, court reporter fees,
filing fees, and deposition fees, whether or not such costs are otherwise recoverable pursuant to the California Code of Civil
Procedure.</P>
