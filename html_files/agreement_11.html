representation, warranty or covenant relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) which such party hereto has not breached will not detract from or mitigate the fact that such party hereto is in breach of
the first representation, warranty, or covenant. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(p) <U>Waiver</U>.&nbsp;No waiver by any party hereto of any default, misrepresentation,
